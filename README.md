# Social-Media-Depression
This project detects signs of depression in social media posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. It preprocesses text data, extracts features using TF-IDF, and trains models with Scikit-learn. Data visualizations are used to analyze trends. The project relies on NLTK for text processing and assumes the availability of a dataset for model training and evaluation.
